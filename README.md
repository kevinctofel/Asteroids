As part of the [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) curriculum, creating Asteroids in Python is a required assignment.

The assignment [begins here](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/5be3e3bd-efb5-4664-a9e9-7111be783271) and the expected output will look like this.

![asteroids](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbc6d2d9-ed98-4319-bffb-94ab091f02b0)

Most of the heavy lifting is done by using the [pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) for Python.

### Current progress as of November 27, 2024

- Player ship is drawn
- Player ship movement is controlled by the keyboard
- Random asteroids are generated
- Collision detection enabled; game ends when the player ship touches and asteroid
- A stream of bullet shots appears from the player when the Space bar is held down. To be fixed.
